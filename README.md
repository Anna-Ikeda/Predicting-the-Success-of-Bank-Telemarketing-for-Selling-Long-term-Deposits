# Predicting-the-Success-of-Bank-Telemarketing-for-Selling-Long-term-Deposits

This project reproduces the methodology from an academic paper to evaluate and compare **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** classifiers for predicting the success of a marketing campaign using the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset.

## 📄 Research Paper

[Predicting the Success of Bank Telemarketing for Selling Long-term Deposits:
An Application of Machine Learning Algorithms]
(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352755139_Predicting_the_Success_of_Bank_Telem[…]erm_Deposits_An_Application_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms))


## 💿 Dataset
- File used: 'bank-additional.csv'

##Requirements 
Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# How to run
1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open the Jupiter or Python script containing the code:
   - classification_bank_marketing.ipynb
3. Ensure the dataset file "bank-additional.csv" is in the same directory
4. Run the entire notebook/scrip
5. You will see:
   - Model evaluations (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC score)
   - Confusion matrices
   - Classification reports
   - Separate ROC Curves for both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

## ✅ Model evaluation metrics 
Both models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC Score
- ROC Curve 
- Confusion Matrix
